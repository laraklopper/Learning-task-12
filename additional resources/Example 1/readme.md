This example is based on this lesson: https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-dynamic-pages
In this code example, we have created a simple blog app. It has a list of all the posts on the home (index) page.
When you click on a post title, you'll be able to see the individual post on its own view.

In this example you will see:

1. how to pass data through using a query string (see /pages/index and pages/post)

2. how to perform route masking (see /pages/index)

To run this code:
1. Copy the example code to your local machine.
2. cd to project folder
3. npm install
4. npm run dev
5. http://localhost:3000/
