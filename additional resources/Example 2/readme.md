This code example is based on this lesson: https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/fetching-data-for-pages
In this example we are going to build an app which shows information about Batman TV Shows, utilising the public TVmaze API: http://www.tvmaze.com/api

You will learn to retrieve data from a remote API using getInitialProps.
To see this, open /pages/index.js and then /pages/post.js.
Also notice the custom server (server.js)

To run this code:
1. Copy the example code to your local machine.
2. cd to project folder
3. npm install
4. npm run dev
5. http://localhost:3000/
