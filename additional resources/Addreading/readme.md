This code resource is considered additional reading for this task. It is based on these tutorials by Aurel Kurtula:
- [Introduction to the basics of Next.js](https://dev.to/aurelkurtula/introduction-to-the-basics-of-nextjs-1loa) - branch : [part1](https://github.com/aurelkurtula/basics-of-nextJS/tree/part1)
- [Retrieving data from an external API](https://dev.to/aurelkurtula/introduction-to-the-basics-of-nextjs---part-two-pad)
- [Introduction to Next.js - adding express and mongo to the project](https://dev.to/aurelkurtula/introduction-to-nextjs---adding-express-and-mongo-to-the-project-2d38)

As with all additional reading, this is optional. What you will see from this code is:
1. How to use  <style global jsx> (See /components/Layout)
2. How to create a custom server that interfaces with MongoDB for Next.js apps.
3. How getInitialProps can be used to fetch data from a database with an Express server with a custom API (see /pages/index, /pages/photo and all files in the server directory)
